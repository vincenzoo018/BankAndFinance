## 💳 **HOW CARD BALANCES WORK:**

**IMPORTANT:** Each card now has its **own separate balance**!

### **Example:**
```
Customer has Account Balance: $10,000

Card 1 (Debit):   $2,000
Card 2 (Credit):  $3,000
Card 3 (Debit):   $1,500
Total in Cards:   $6,500

Remaining in Account: $3,500
```

### **Deposit Flow:**
1. Customer deposits $1,000 cash
2. Selects "Card 1" as destination
3. Money goes directly to Card 1 balance
4. Card 1 balance becomes $3,000

### **Withdraw Flow:**
1. Customer withdraws $500
2. Must select which card to use
3. Money deducted from that card's balance
4. Card balance updates immediately

### **Pay Bills Flow:**
1. Customer pays $200 electric bill
2. Selects payment card
3. Card balance reduces by $200
4. Bill payment recorded
