## 💳 **CARD SYSTEM LOGIC**

### **Critical Rule: Only Selected Card is Affected**

**Scenario: User has 3 cards**
```
Card 1 (Debit):   $2,000
Card 2 (Credit):  $5,000
Card 3 (Debit):   $1,500
```

**Action: Transfer $500**
1. User selects **Card 2** for payment
2. Enters amount: $500
3. Confirms transfer
4. **Result:**
   - Card 1: $2,000 (unchanged ✅)
   - Card 2: $4,500 (decreased ✅)
   - Card 3: $1,500 (unchanged ✅)

**✅ ONLY Card 2 was deducted because it was selected!**

This applies to:
- ✅ Deposits (if card selected)
- ✅ Withdrawals (required card selection)
- ✅ Bill Payments (required card selection)
- ✅ Transfers (required card selection) ← NEW
