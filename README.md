## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- SQL Server (LocalDB or Express)

### Step 1: Clone/Open the Project
Open the project in Visual Studio.

### Step 2: Update Database Connection String
Edit `appsettings.json` and update the connection string if needed:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=BFASDatabase;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Install NuGet Packages
The required packages are already specified in `BankAndFinance.csproj`. Restore them:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Or in Visual Studio: **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Restore NuGet Packages**

### Step 4: Create Database with Migrations

Open **Package Manager Console** (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console) and run:

```powershell
Add-Migration InitialCreate
Update-Database
```

This will:
- Create the database with all tables
- Seed initial data (Roles, Users, Bank Accounts, Billers, Branches)

### Step 5: Run the Application

Press **F5** or click **Run** in Visual Studio. The application will start at `https://localhost:5001` (or your configured port).
