## üí≥ **HOW IT WORKS**

### **Withdrawal Flow:**
```
1. Customer clicks Withdraw
2. System fetches active cards from database
3. Customer selects a card
4. System validates:
   - Card exists
   - Card belongs to customer
   - Account has sufficient balance
5. Withdrawal processed
6. Transaction recorded with card info
   Format: "Card - Debit (**** 1234)"
```

### **Card Selection Logic:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cards 
WHERE account_id = @accountId 
AND card_status = 'Active'
```

### **Payment Mode Storage:**
- **Deposits**: Always "Cash"
- **Withdrawals**: "Card - {Type} (**** {Last4})"
- Stored in `transactions.payment_mode`

---

## üîê **PAYMONGO USAGE EXAMPLES**

### **Creating a Payment Intent:**
```csharp
// Inject PayMongoService
private readonly IPayMongoService _payMongoService;

// Create payment intent
var result = await _payMongoService.CreatePaymentIntent(
    amount: 1000.00m,  // PHP 1,000.00
    description: "Card withdrawal",
    currency: "PHP"
);

if (result.Success)
{
    // Parse result.Data (JSON response)
    // Redirect user to payment page
}
```

### **Creating a GCash Source:**
```csharp
var result = await _payMongoService.CreateSource(
    amount: 500.00m,
    type: "gcash",
    currency: "PHP"
);

if (result.Success)
{
    // Get redirect URL from result.Data
    // Redirect user to GCash payment page
}
```
