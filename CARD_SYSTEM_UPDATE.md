## 📊 **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Current Design:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Bank Account   │ ← Main balance container
│  Balance: $1000 │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ├─── Card 1 (Debit)   ← Used for tracking only
         ├─── Card 2 (Credit)  ← Used for tracking only
         └─── Card 3 (Debit)   ← Used for tracking only
```

**How it Works:**
1. All money goes to/from the **Bank Account**
2. Cards are **payment methods** that deduct from account
3. Deposits can be **tagged to a specific card** for tracking
4. Transaction history shows which card was used

---

## 📋 **PAYMENT FLOW**

### **Deposit Flow:**
```
Customer → Cash Deposit → [Optional: Select Card] → Bank Account (+)
         └─→ Transaction saved: "Cash Deposit to Card - Debit (**** 1234)"
```

### **Withdrawal Flow:**
```
Customer → Select Card (Required) → Bank Account (-)
         └─→ Transaction saved: "Card - Debit (**** 1234)"
```

### **Pay Bills Flow:**
```
Customer → Select Biller → Amount → Select Card (Required) → Bank Account (-)
         └─→ Transaction saved: "Card - Debit (**** 1234)"
```

## ❓ **PENDING CLARIFICATIONS**

I've asked you several questions to implement additional features. Please answer these:

### **1. Card Balance System**
- **Current:** Cards don't have individual balances, they use the main account balance
- **Question:** Do you want each card to have its **own separate balance**?
  - If YES: When depositing to Card A, only Card A balance increases
  - If NO: Keep current system (cards just track transactions)

### **2. Bill Payment Method**
- **Question:** Should bill payments:
  - Use existing card balance (deduct from account)?
  - OR use PayMongo gateway (external payment)?
  - OR both options?

### **3. Card Management**
- **Question:** Should customers be able to:
  - Add new cards themselves?
  - Delete/Block their own cards?
